CoreVeritas is a 501c3 nonprofit that was founded on the belief that what we choose to talk about matters.  However, we often can not identify the core issue or know how to begin the conversation.  Unaddressed issues block conversation and stunt growth.

We also believe that teams matter.  Yet, most leadership work is done on an individual level.  We have taken the approach that individual leadership is enhanced in the context of the team. 

Together, we are facilitating the growth, the vitality of organizations and communities through meaningful conversations on the core issues and effective teams focused on these core issues.
