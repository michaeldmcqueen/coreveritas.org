			        <h1>Let’s Talk About Rob - A new documentary from Nick Weidner and Core Communites</h1>
			        <h2>Rob was overjoyed when he was told he had terminal cancer at 44. He was floundering, depressed, and flirting with multiple addictions, so knowing how he would die finally made him excited to live. </h2>
			        <p>As Rob unfolds his life in front of the camera, we realize that he spends more time battling his mental health than he does cancer. The film explores what makes his joyful reaction so unique, while confronting his depression, alcoholism and drug abuse. Fighting cancer gave Rob the illusion of overcoming his mental health issues, but actually allowed them to thrive even more.</p> 
              <p>We often give much more empathy and understanding to someone diagnosed with cancer than to someone suffering from mental health issues. In this documentary, we want to highlight why we as a society should fight depression like a cancer of the mind. We need to understand the long struggle of depression, and have more compassion for those with mental illness and Rob’s history can help open the door for meaningful discussions. </p>
              <p>With your donation, we can continue documenting Rob’s story and explore what effective and groundbreaking treatments look like.</p>
              <p>Each day is unpromised, but we’ll always be ready for whatever life brings, and for when Rob decides to frame up the final shot. </p>
